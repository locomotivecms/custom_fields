h1. CustomFields

Manage custom fields to a mongoid document or a collection. This module is one of the core features we implemented in our custom cms named Locomotive.
Basically, its aim is to provide to editors a way to manage extra fields to a Mongoid document through, for instance, a web UI.

The main goals:

* offering a very secure way to add / edit / delete extra fields to a Mongoid document
* scoping the modifications added to a Mongoid document so that other documents of the same class won't be updated.

h2. Requirements

ActiveSupport 3.2.1, MongoDB 2.0 and Mongoid 2.4.3

h2. Examples

h3. On a has_many relationship

bc.. class Company
  include CustomFields::Source

  has_many :employees

  custom_fields_for :employees
end

class Employee
  include CustomFields::Target

  field :name, String

  belongs_to :company, :inverse_of => :employees
end

company = Company.new
company.employees_custom_fields.build :label => 'His/her position', :name => 'position', :type => 'string', :required => true

company.save

company.employees.build :name => 'Michael Scott', :position => 'Regional manager'

another_company = Company.new
employee = company.employees.build
employee.position # returns a "not defined method" error

h3. On the class itself

[IN PROGRESS]

bc.. class Company
  custom_fields_for_itself
end

company = Company.new
company.self_metadata_custom_fields.build :label => 'Shipping Address', :name => 'address', :type => 'text'

company.save

company.self_metadata.address = '700 S Laflin, 60607 Chicago'

another_company = Company.new
other_company.self_metadata.address # returns a "not defined method" error
